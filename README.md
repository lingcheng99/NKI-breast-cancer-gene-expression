# NKI-breast-cancer-gene-expression

This dataset is gene xpression data from a breast cancer study published by van't Veer et al. in 2002 and van de Vijver et al. in 2002, available as a package from Bioconductor. After some data exploration, I chose five-year metastasis-free survival as the target variable.
